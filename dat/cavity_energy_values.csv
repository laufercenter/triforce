# Cavity formation free energy values in 300 K TIP3P in kcal/mol. The block begins with the
# number of y points, and includes row and column labels for sigma and epsilon, respectively.
# Epsilon values are given in kJ/mol, and distances in angstroms.

# Note: We should unify these values to one energy unit (i.e., always use kJ/mol even in output)
